## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Navigate to the damage declaration page:
```
http://localhost:3000/damageDeclaration
```

### 3. Test the flow:
1. Fill out the insurance info form (Step 1)
2. Click "استعلام هویت" (Verify Identity)
3. After verification, click continue
4. Notice URL changes to: `/damageDeclaration/insurancePolicy/temp-[timestamp]`
5. Fill out insurance policy form (Step 2)
6. Click "بعدی" (Next)
7. Notice URL changes to: `/damageDeclaration/accident/temp-[timestamp]`
8. Continue through placeholder steps

### 4. Test browser navigation:
- Click browser back button → Goes to previous step ✅
- Click browser forward button → Goes to next step ✅
- Refresh page → Data persists ✅
- Copy URL and open in new tab → Works ✅

## 🔧 Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### Immediate (Ready to Use):
✅ Steps 1 & 2 are fully functional
✅ Navigation between steps works
✅ Temporary save works
✅ Browser navigation works

### Short-term (Implementation Needed):

#### 1. Implement Backend Integration
Replace temporary ID generation with actual API calls:

**In `src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/page.tsx` (Line ~70):**
```typescript
// Replace this:
const declarationId = `temp-${Date.now()}`;

// With this:
const response = await fetch('/api/damage-declaration/create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
});
const { id } = await response.json();
const declarationId = id;
```

#### 2. Create Remaining Form Components
You need to implement these components:

**Priority 1 - Accident Form:**
```bash
Create: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/components/accident-form.tsx
Update: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/accident/[id]/page.tsx
```

**Priority 2 - Damaged Items Form:**
```bash
Create: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/components/damaged-items-form.tsx
Update: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/cases/[id]/page.tsx
```

**Priority 3 - Beneficiaries Form:**
```bash
Create: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/components/beneficiaries-form.tsx
Update: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/documents/[id]/page.tsx
```

**Priority 4 - Review Component:**
```bash
Create: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/components/review-summary.tsx
Update: src/app/(panel)/damageDeclaration/review/[id]/page.tsx
```

See `IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md` for detailed templates and guidance!

## 🎨 Current Features

### ✅ Working Features:
- Multi-step form with URL-based navigation

- Step 1: Insurance info form (fully functional)
- Step 2: Insurance policy form (fully functional)
- Temporary save functionality
- Browser back/forward navigation

- Responsive design

### ⏳ Placeholder Features (Need Implementation):
- Step 3: Accident details form
- Step 4: Damaged items form
- Step 5: Beneficiaries form
- Step 6: Review & submit
- Backend API integration

---

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### URL Pattern:
```
Step 1: /damageDeclaration
Step 2: /damageDeclaration/insurancePolicy/[id]
Step 3: /damageDeclaration/accident/[id]
Step 4: /damageDeclaration/cases/[id]
Step 5: /damageDeclaration/documents/[id]
Step 6: /damageDeclaration/review/[id]
```

### Data Storage:
```javascript
// Each declaration has its own localStorage key
localStorage.setItem('damage-declaration-form-data-{id}', JSON.stringify(data));

// This allows multiple concurrent declarations
```

### Navigation Flow:
```
User submits Step 1 
  → Backend creates declaration (gets ID)
  → Navigate to Step 2 with ID
  → User completes Step 2
  → Navigate to Step 3 with same ID
  → ... continue through all steps
  → Final submission in Step 6
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page not found error
**Solution:** Make sure Next.js dev server is running and you've restarted it after creating new routes.

### Issue: Form data not persisting
**Solution:** Check browser localStorage for keys starting with `damage-declaration-form-data-`

### Issue: ID not passing between steps
**Solution:** Check the `router.push()` calls include the `declarationId` parameter

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:** Run `npm run build` or check with VS Code's TypeScript checker

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use the documentation files** - They contain detailed examples and templates
2. **Test frequently** - Each step works independently, test as you implement
3. **Follow the pattern** - Steps 1 & 2 are good examples for implementing remaining steps
4. **Keep components reusable** - Separate form logic from page routing
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Add try-catch blocks for API calls
