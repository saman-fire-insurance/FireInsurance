---

## 📝 Changes Made to `content.tsx`

### 1. **Added Imports**
```typescript
// Added step icons
import { 
  X, 
  Save, 
  User,           // Step 1 icon ✅
  BookCheck,      // Step 2 icon
  Home,           // Step 3 icon
  List,           // Step 4 icon
  FileText,       // Step 5 icon
  CircleCheck     // Step 6 icon
} from "lucide-react";

// Added WizardSteps component
import WizardSteps from "./components/wizardSteps";
```

### 2. **Defined Steps Array**
```typescript
const steps = [
  { id: "insured", label: "بیمه‌گذار", icon: User },
  { id: "policy", label: "بیمه نامه", icon: BookCheck },
  { id: "accident", label: "حادثه", icon: Home },
  { id: "cases", label: "موارد آسیب دیده", icon: List },
  { id: "documents", label: "ذینفعان", icon: FileText },
  { id: "review", label: "بررسی", icon: CircleCheck },
];
```

### 3. **Added State Management**
```typescript
const [completedSteps, setCompletedSteps] = useState<number[]>([]); // No steps completed yet
const currentStep = 0; // This is step 1 (index 0)
```

### 4. **Added Step Click Handler**
```typescript
const handleStepClick = (index: number) => {
  // For step 1, we can't navigate with ID yet since it hasn't been created
  // Only allow clicking on step 1 (current step)
  if (index === 0) {
    // Already on this page, do nothing or scroll to top
    window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' });
  }
  // Other steps are not accessible until form is submitted and ID is created
};
```

### 5. **Rendered WizardSteps Component**
```tsx
{/* Wizard Steps */}
<WizardSteps
  steps={steps}
  currentStep={currentStep}
  completedSteps={completedSteps}
  handleStepClick={handleStepClick}
/>
```

---

## 🎨 Visual Representation

### Step 1 View (Starting Point)
```
[● بیمه‌گذار] → [ بیمه نامه] → [ حادثه] → [ موارد آسیب دیده] → [ ذینفعان] → [ بررسی]
   Active        Pending       Pending      Pending              Pending       Pending
```

**Legend:**
- ● = Active (current step - highlighted)
- ☐ = Pending (not yet accessible - grayed out)

---

## 🔒 Navigation Behavior on Step 1

Since this is the first step and no declaration ID has been created yet:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Click on Step 1 (بیمه‌گذار) | Scrolls to top of page (already on this step) |
| Click on Step 2-6 | No action (ID not created yet) |
| Submit form | Creates ID and navigates to Step 2 |

**Note:** Once the user submits the insurance info form, a declaration ID is created, and they can navigate between steps freely.
