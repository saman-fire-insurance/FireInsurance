## ADR-001: Adopt Rich Domain Model Pattern for Core Business Entities

### Status
Decided

### Context
Our application requires complex business logic with multiple business rules and invariants that need to be consistently enforced. The system will handle core business operations where domain rules must be consistently applied and business concepts need to be clearly expressed in code.

### Decision
We will adopt the **Rich Domain Model** pattern for core business entities, placing business methods directly on domain objects rather than in separate service classes.

### Rationale

**Encapsulation and Data Integrity**
- Business rules are enforced at the object level, preventing invalid state transitions
- Domain invariants are automatically maintained within entity boundaries
- Private fields prevent external tampering with internal state

**Better Object-Oriented Design**
- Follows the principle of "data and behavior belong together"
- Objects are responsible for their own state transitions
- More cohesive code with related logic grouped in one place

**Expressiveness and Maintainability**
- Code reads like business language: `account.Withdraw(100)` vs `accountService.Withdraw(account, 100)`
- Domain concepts are clearly expressed in the code structure
- Business logic changes happen in one predictable place

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Business invariants automatically enforced, reducing bugs
- Domain concepts clearly expressed in code structure
- Easier for domain experts to validate business logic
- Reduced risk of duplicating business rules across services
- Better long-term maintainability as business complexity grows

#### Negative
- Initial development may be slower due to increased complexity
- May require additional mapping layers for persistence
- Team will need training on DDD principles and rich domain modeling
- Testing may become more complex due to stateful domain objects

#### Implementation Notes
- Start with most critical business entities (core aggregates)
- Implement gradual migration strategy rather than big-bang approach
- Establish coding standards for domain method design
- Consider persistence mapping strategies early in implementation
