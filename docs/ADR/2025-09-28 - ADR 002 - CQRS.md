## ADR-002: Adopt CQRS Pattern with MediatR Implementation

### Status
Decided

### Context
Our application handles complex business operations with different read and write requirements. We need clear separation between command operations (writes) and query operations (reads), along with a way to organize and orchestrate business logic handlers. The system requires scalable architecture that supports different optimization strategies for reads versus writes.

### Decision
We will implement the **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern using MediatR** as the mediator library for orchestrating commands, queries, and their respective handlers.

### Rationale

**Clear Separation of Concerns**
- Commands handle write operations and business rule enforcement
- Queries handle read operations with optimized data retrieval
- Different models can be optimized for their specific use cases
- Handlers contain focused business logic for single operations

**Improved Code Organization**
- Each business operation has a dedicated handler class
- Request/response contracts are explicitly defined
- Cross-cutting concerns handled through MediatR pipeline behaviors
- Clean separation between API layer and business logic

**Scalability and Flexibility**
- Read and write sides can be scaled independently
- Different data stores can be used for commands vs queries
- Pipeline behaviors provide centralized handling of validation, logging, and caching
- Supports eventual consistency patterns when needed

**Testability and Maintainability**
- Handlers can be unit tested in isolation
- Clear input/output contracts make testing straightforward
- Business logic changes are localized to specific handlers
- Easier to mock dependencies and test edge cases

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Clear separation between read and write operations
- Improved code organization with single-responsibility handlers
- Better testability through isolated handler classes
- Scalable architecture supporting independent optimization
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns through pipeline behaviors

#### Negative
- Increased initial complexity compared to simple CRUD operations
- More classes and files to maintain
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with CQRS and MediatR
- Potential for over-engineering simple operations

#### Implementation Notes
- Create separate folders for Commands, Queries, and Handlers
- Implement pipeline behaviors for validation, logging, and error handling
- Use strongly-typed request/response objects
- Consider using different data models for read vs write operations
- Establish naming convention
