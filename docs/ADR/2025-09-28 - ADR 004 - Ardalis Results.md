## ADR-004: Adopt Ardalis.Result for Standardized Result Handling

### Status
Decided

### Context
Our CQRS implementation with MediatR requires consistent error handling and result patterns across all command and query handlers. We need a standardized way to handle success/failure states, validation errors, and different types of business exceptions without relying on thrown exceptions for control flow. The API layer needs consistent response formats for different result types.

### Decision
We will adopt **Ardalis.Result** as our standardized result handling pattern for MediatR handlers and API responses.

### Rationale

**Standardized Success/Failure Handling**
- Explicit result types that clearly indicate success or failure states
- Type-safe error handling without relying on exceptions for control flow
- Consistent result patterns across all handlers and operations
- Clear separation between different types of failures (NotFound, Validation, Unauthorized)

**Improved API Response Consistency**
- Standardized response formats across all endpoints
- Predictable error structures for frontend consumers
- Easy conversion from Result objects to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Consistent handling of validation errors and business rule violations

**Better Testability and Maintainability**
- Handlers return explicit success/failure states that are easy to test
- No hidden exception paths that can break tests
- Clear contracts for what each handler can return
- Easier to reason about error handling in complex business operations

**Performance Benefits**
- Avoids expensive exception throwing for expected business failures
- Reduces try-catch blocks throughout the application
- More predictable performance characteristics
- Better stack trace preservation when actual exceptions occur

### Consequences

#### Positive
- Consistent error handling patterns across all handlers and endpoints
- Improved API response predictability for frontend developers
- Better performance by avoiding exceptions for control flow
- Clearer handler contracts and improved testability
- Type-safe error handling with compile-time guarantees

#### Negative
- Additional dependency to manage and maintain
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Result patterns
- More verbose handler code compared to simple return values
- Need to create extension methods for API integration

#### Implementation Notes
- Create extension methods to convert Result objects to IResult for Minimal APIs
- Establish conventions for different result types (Success, NotFound, Validation, etc.)
- Implement consistent error response formats across all endpoints
- Use Result<T> for operations that return data, Result for operations that don't
- Consider using Result patterns for domain method returns as well
